#Suppose you have two sets of employee data—one containing information about full-time employees and another containing information about part-time employees. You want to combine this data to create a comprehensive employee dataset for HR analysis. 
#Input: # Employee data for full-time employees
#full_time_employees = np.array([
#[101, 'John Doe', 'Full-Time', 55000],
#[102, 'Jane Smith', 'Full-Time', 60000], 
#[103, 'Mike Johnson', 'Full-Time', 52000] 
#])
# Employee data for part-time employees :
#part_time_employees = np.array([ 
#[201, 'Alice Brown', 'Part-Time', 25000], 
#[202, 'Bob Wilson', 'Part-Time', 28000],
#[203, 'Emily Davis', 'Part-Time', 22000]
#])
